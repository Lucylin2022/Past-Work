# Past Work
Hello! My name is Lucy Lin! Here is a showcase of my projects, notes, and assignments related data analysis that I have completed.  
I chose to leave out assignment prompts to miminize visibility of my academic work in search engines, but I hope this sufficiently encompasses a general sense of my experience with data and statistical analysis. 
Thank you for reading!
